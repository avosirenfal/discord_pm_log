# What is this?
Quick and dirty Python 3.8 script to save all private messages from a Discord user account to local files. It saves the last point where messages were downloaded to allow repeat runs without hitting the Discord API unnecessarily.

# How do I get my Discord user token?
Google elsewhere.

# Installation

This is not tested on any platform besides Linux, but I don't see any reason it shouldn't work on Windows.

Download the script and install the following libraries with pip:

pip install tzlocal unidecode requests
